delegates in C# allow u to reference a method like a variable creating for more flexible and dynamic program
There are 2 types of delegates
1.single cast - we can call 1 delegate to 1 function 
2.multi cast - we can call 1 delegate to multiple function

delegates used for event handling program

Can we call directly


Event handling -
An event is a notification mechanisms So button does not know how will handle the key It only raise the event

Event allow object to communicate with each other by sending signals when something interesting happens.
Cannot be call directly outside the class
